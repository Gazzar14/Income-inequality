# The impact of government expenditure on education on income inequality in the MENA region: Panel analysis on the time period from 1990 to 2017.
#### Description:
This paper analyzes the effect of government educational spending has on income inequality .
Dependent variable : Income inequality represented by the GINI index
Independent Variable: Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP)
####Control Variables:
•	Unemployment, total (% of total labor force)
•	GDP per capita growth (annual %)
•	Age dependency ratio (% of working-age population)
•	Population growth (annual %)
•	School enrollment, primary (% gross)
•	School enrollment, secondary (% gross)
•	School enrollment, tertiary (%gross)
•	Urban population (% of total population)
•	Population density (people per sq. km of land area)
•	Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)
•	Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP)
•	Consumer price index (2010 = 100)
•	Urban population (% of total population)
#### Methodology:
Our goal is to fit a significant model that captures the magnitude of the effect government education expenditure has on income inequality, the latter of which is represented by the Gini index. Whereas a value of 0 for the Gini index implies a perfect income distribution and 100% implies perfect income inequality.
Pooled OLS is the simplest way of estimating any panel data set however its assumptions must be met . This study chose Pooled estimation not only for its simplicity but also due the small data set at hand . It could be assumed that the model will not suffer from autocorrelation since observations weren’t recorded in the exact same period and they’re of limited quantity .In order to achieve a statistically viable model all the variables that affect income inequality has to be taken into consideration. However some of these variables are not quantifiable thus, we selected a group variable that are proven statistically significant. Which are as follows: unemployment rate, population growth, GDP per capita, and educational enrollment for primary, secondary, and tertiary Vazquez et al. (2012). And according to Kaasa (2003), there are about 14 variables that explain 68.6% of variability of the GINI index. Namely; unemployment, inflation, Government expenditure on education and health as a percentage of GDP, school enrolment (primary), growth of population, population density.
